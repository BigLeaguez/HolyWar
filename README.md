## Rules to the game

### BASICS

The aim of the game is to score more points and win the game by using strategic formations and executing plays to gain yards. The field is a 24x13 checkered board, with each square measuring 5 yards. You have 8 players to place in formations of your choosing on the field for both offense and defense.

You get 4 downs per possession, with no first downs (at 4th down, you can either go for it, punt, or kick a field goal).

There are 10 downs per quarter, totalling 40 per game.

When game reaches half-time, play is dead, and new possession begins at beginning of 3rd quarter (player who didn't get the ball to begin the game gets it here).

Play clock is set to 30 seconds each time you start a new play (5 yard penalty is enforced).

Players can agree to a timeout if you need to step away shortly.

### PLAYERS

(Number in square brackets signifies quantity):

    OFFENSIVE PLAYERS
    [1] Quarterback (QB)
    [1] Runningback (RB)
    [2] Wide Receiver (WR)
    [1] Tight End (TE)
    [3] Offensive Lineman (OL)

    DEFENSIVE PLAYERS
    [2] Safety (S)
    [3] Cornerback (CB)
    [3] Defensive Lineman (DL)

### SPEEDS

Each player on the field has designated movement speeds that you have some control over choosing. This speed limits each player to the amount of squares they can run in one turn.

Movement speeds are as follows (red indicates player position, yellow indicates potential movement):

    1+
    2+
    2*
    3+

(+ signifies movements only to squares directly touching the square the player is on, whereas * signifies movements to diagonally touching squares).

The QB has a throwing radius of 6 squares, meaning it takes one turn for the ball to travel 6 direct squares if thrown straight.

Tip: The QB doesn't have to be the one throwing the ball; each offensive player besides the OL can at a radius of 4 squares. In order to do this, you either have to snap the ball to another player or have the QB pitch the ball backwards while still behind scrimmage.

(The red square indicates the player's position, and the yellow squares shows where he can throw it in 1 turn).

    6R (QB)
    4R (All others)

## ORDER OF PLAY

### Start the game

1: SPEED SELECTION: You will be shown your players to put on the field and the list of movement speeds. Match up the speeds to the players in any way you'd like (after both players choose the speeds for their players, the other will be able to see what was chosen).

2: COIN TOSS: A player at random will choose heads or tails. Whomever wins gets home field and can choose to receive or defer the first possession. The team who kicks off to start the game receives the kickoff at the beginning of the second half.

### Start the play

1: SET FORMATION: Both players set their players however they'd like, while their opponent's formation is hidden. After both set, their opponent sees.

2: FREE MOVEMENT OPTION: Before the snap, the offense can make one adjustment to their formation (i.e. QB to shotgun, WR to other side, etc).

3: HIKE: The play begins, and offense can move up to 3 players based on their movement speed.

4: DEFENSE: The defense will move up to 3 players, and so on until the ball goes dead. Then start a new play.
